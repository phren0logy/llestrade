## Instructions

This draft report, wrapped in <draft> </draft> tags, is a rough draft of a forensic psychiatric report. Perform the following steps in sequential order to improve the report:

1. Ignore the contents of block quotes. The errors belong to the source document being quoted. Never modify the contents of block quotes.
2. Check each section for information that is repeated in other sections. Put this information in the most appropriate section. If a template is provided, it will be wrapped in <template> </template> tags. If duplicate information is found, after placing it in the most appropriate section, reference that section in other parts of the report where that information was removed.
3. After making those changes, revise the document for readability. Preserve details that are important for accurate diagnosis and formulation. Make sure that verbs are in past tense for information that came from the interview. Do not use the word "denied," instead say "did not report," "did not endorse," etc.
4. Check the report against a transcript, if provided. The transcript is wrapped in <transcript> </transcript> tags. Pay careful attention to direct quotes. Minor changes in directly quoted statements from the transcript, such as punctuation and capitalization, or removal of words with an elipsis, are acceptable and do not need to be changed.
5. Use the words instead of numerals for one through ten, and numbers for 11 and above. Spell out decades, such as "twenties" instead of 20s.
6. Some information may not appear in the transcript, such as quotes from other documents or psychometric testing. Do not make changes to this information that does not appear in the transcript. Do make a note of it in your thinking.
7. Output only the final revised report.
