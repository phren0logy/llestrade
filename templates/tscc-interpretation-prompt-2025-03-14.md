# TSCC Interpretation

The Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) is a self-report measure of posttraumatic distress and related psychological symptomatology. It is intended for use in the evaluation of children who have experienced traumatic events, including childhood physical and sexual abuse, victimization by peers (e.g., physical or sexual assault), major losses, the witnessing of violence done to others, and natural disasters.

The following is a guide to the interpretation of TSCC score report.

## Normative Comparisons

T scores are used to interpret the child's level of symptomatology on the TSCC. These scores are standardized transformations of the raw scale scores, derived so as to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Similar to percentile scores, T scores provide information about the individual's scores relative to the scores of subjects in the standardization sample. For example, a T score of 65 would indicate that the respondent's score is 1.5 standard deviations above the stan- dardization sample mean and equals or exceeds the scores of 94% of the subjects comprising the standard- ization sample. For all clinical scales except SC and its subscales, T scores at or above 65 are considered clinically significant. T scores in the range of 60 through 65 are suggestive of difficulty and may represent sub-clinical (but significant) symptomatology. For the SC scale and its subscales SC-P and SC-D, T scores at or above 70 are considered clinically significant, as noted in the section of this chapter labeled "Sexual Concerns."

## Interpreting TSCC Scores

Examination of scores on the individual scales of the TSCC reveals specific areas in which the child may be experiencing symptomatology. Although this section presents interpretive hypotheses for each scale individually, the scales of the TSCC are not independent, and relationships among them should be considered when interpreting scores.

Scale and Subscale Composition:

- Validity Scales
  - Underresponse (UND)
  - Hyperresponse (HYP)
- Clinical Scales
  - Anxiety (ANX)
  - Depression (DEP)
  - Anger (ANG)
  - Posttraumatic Stress (PTS)
  - Dissociation (DIS)
    - Overt Dissociation (DIS-O)
    - Fantasy (DIS-F)
  - Sexual Concerns (SC)
    - Sexual Preoccupations (SC-P)
    - Sexual Distress (SC-D)

### Validity Scales

The TSCC has two validity scales: one that taps a child's tendency to deny any symptomatology and one that indexes a tendency to overrespond to symptom items.

### Underresponse (UND)

The Underresponse scale (UND) consists of the number of 0s endorsed for those items least likely to receive a 0 in the normative sample. It reflects a tendency toward denial, a general underendorsement response set, or a need to appear unusually symptom-free.

It is not uncommon for some children to indiscriminately mark 0s on symptom checklist measures rather than refuse to complete the test. The Underresponse (UND) scale was specifically developed to determine if the child is responding in this manner. This scale consists of the 10 TSCC items that were least likely to receive a 0 rating in the normative sample, and the Underresponse score is the number of 0s the child marked plus the number of UND items to which the child did not respond at all.

Given the above, the UND scale reflects the extent to which the respondent denied behaviors, thoughts, or feelings that most others would report at some nonzero level (e.g., Daydreaming). Respondents with very high scores on this scale (i.e., children who marked an inordinate number of 0s) are likely to be especially defensive or avoidant, oppositional regarding test-taking, or, for some other reason, unwilling to endorse commonly endorsed items. In the standardization sample, individuals with an UND T score above 70 were in the top 2% of UND item endorsers. It is recommended that TSCCs with UND scores of 70T or higher be considered invalid and that children with UND scores ranging from 65T to 70T be viewed as possibly underresponding. All 10 UND items are nonsexual in content and, thus, are found in both the TSCC and TSCC-A.

### Hyperresponse (HYP)

The Hyperresponse (HYP) scale consists of the number of 3s marked on diverse items that rarely received a 3 in the normative sample. It indicates a general overresponse to TSCC items, a specific need to appear especially symptomatic, or a state of being overwhelmed by traumatic stress.

Another test-taking behavior occasionally seen in children's symptom checklist responses is when the child indiscriminately endorses the highest frequency point for many or all symptom items. The Hyperresponse (HYP) scale evaluates this phenomenon by indicating the number of 3s endorsed for 8 relatively diverse TSCC items that infrequently received 3s in the normative sample (see chapter 5 for further information on the construction of this scale).

Thus, children with elevated HYP scores are those who relatively indiscriminately overendorse uncommon TSCC items, typically reflecting a generalized overresponse style, a desire to appear especially distressed or dysfunctional, or a "cry for help." In the standardization sample, individuals with a HYP T score of 90 or above were in the top 1% of HYP item endorsers.

It is recommended that TSCC protocols with HYP scores of 90T or higher be considered invalid and that children with scores ranging from 75T to 89T be considered potential overresponders. The relatively high valid- ity cutoff for HYP (T > 89) takes into account (a) the tendency for children in mental health settings to endorse more TSCC items with 3s for valid reasons than do respondents in the general population, and (b) the need to avoid labeling as invalid the responses of children who are overwhelmed by trauma but who, nevertheless, are attempting to respond to items accurately. As with the UND scale, all 8 HYP items are nonsexual in content and, thus, are found in both the TSCC and TSCC-A.

### Clinical Scales

The clinical scales of the TSCC measure the extent to which the child endorses six different types of potentially trauma-related symptoms. Five of the six scales (all but PTS) are nonoverlapping at the item level. Two of these clinical scales (DIS and SC) also contain scorable subscales, based upon principle components analyses and scale content.

#### Anxiety (ANX)

The Anxiety (AND) scale items seek to measure the following: Generalized anxiety, hyperarousal, and worry; specific fears (e.g., of men, women, or both; of the dark; of being killed); episodes of free-floating anxiety; and a sense of impending danger.

Scores on the Anxiety (ANX) scale reflect the extent to which the child is experiencing generalized anxiety, hyperarousal, and worry, as well as specific fears of men or women, of the dark, and of being killed. Also tapped by this scale are episodes of free-floating anxiety and fears of impending danger.

Clinically elevated scores on the ANX scale may reflect the presence of an anxiety disorder or the anxious hyperarousal associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, or both. Because the content of ANX involves multiple references to danger, high scores on this scale may reflect posttraumatic fears associated with previous victimization or with having witnessed violence against others. Other children with elevated ANX scores, however, may project their anxiety into unrealistic fears of events that have not occurred.

#### Depression (DEP)

The Depression (DEP) scale taps feelings of sadness, unhappiness, and loneliness; episodes of tearfulness; and depressive cognitions such as guilt and self-denigration. This scale contains two critical items referring to self-injurious impulses and suicide.

Principle components analysis revealed two underlying factors, one consisting of all DEP items except the two that describe a desire to hurt or kill oneself, and one consisting of these remaining two items. Because self-injuriousness and suicidality are important aspects of more severe depression, and because both of these items appear as separate critical items, no Depression subscales were created.

High scores on the DEP scale may signal a depressive episode, a grief or depressive reaction, or a more long-term dysthymic process. Individuals with clinically elevated DEP scores may avoid social interactions with other children and seclude themselves physically. They are likely to see themselves as bad and unworthy and may describe feelings of self-hatred. Elevations on DEP may be associated with suicidality or self-injurious behavior, especially when either critical item involving self-harm (Items 20 and 52 on the TSCC and Items 17 and 43 on the TSCC-A) is endorsed above 0. Non- suicidal self-mutilatory behaviors may be present for some children (especially adolescents), involving cutting, piercing, or burning of the arms, legs, or other body parts. An evaluation for suicidality or self-injury is indicated whenever DEP is clinically elevated or either critical item is endorsed above 0.

#### Anger (ANG)

Scores on the Anger (ANG) scale indicate the extent of angry thoughts, feelings, and behaviors reported by the child. Items of the ANG scale include feeling mad and mean, feeling hatred, having difficulty de-escalating anger, wanting to yell at or hurt people, and arguing and fighting.

Children scoring high on the ANG scale are often seen by others as irritable, hostile, or aggressive. They may get into trouble at school or at home for fighting, having temper tantrums, or "talking back," and they may have trouble in social contexts arising from their angry outbursts or aggression toward peers. Other children

with elevated ANG scores may not draw attention to themselves through their angry behavior but, neverthe- less, may feel angry or resentful about previous mal- treatment, abandonment, or perceived unfair treatment. Chronic exposure to neighborhood violence appears to especially increase ANG scores in some children (Singer et al., 1995). One ANG item (Wanting to hurt other people) is a critical item and should be followed- up if endorsed above 0.

### Posttraumatic Stress (PTS)

The Posttraumatic Stress (PTS) scale consists of items reflecting classic posttraumatic symptoms. These include intrusive thoughts, sensations, and memories of painful past events; nightmares; fears of men or women; and cognitive avoidance of negative thoughts and memories. This scale includes considerably more intrusive symptoms than avoidance or hyperarousal symptoms, and thus should not be considered a comprehensive measure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), per se. Those wishing to evaluate the broader range of PTSD symptomatology may wish to examine the TSCC PTS scale in the context of elevations on ANX and DIS scales, or they may choose to administer other measures that more explicitly tap hyperarousal and avoidance (e.g., the Child Post-Traumatic Stress Reaction Index). Ultimately, however, the diagnosis of PTSD should be made in the context of a face-to-face interview, using criteria of the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994).

Principle components analysis revealed three factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0: one characterized solely by intrusive recollections of traumatic events, and two containing a mix of sensory reexperiencing and nightmares, dissociative avoidance, and fears. Based on the lack of clinically meaningful factors arising from this analysis, it was decided to avoid specific PTS subscales.

Children with elevated PTS scores are often preoccupied with one or more traumatic events in the past; they frequently describe intrusive and persistent recollections and sensory reexperiencing of these events. These symptoms can be disruptive of normal daily functioning, resulting in anxious distractibility or irritability. Posttraumatic rumination is also common, wherein the child repetitively thinks about these upsetting events, blames him- or herself, or imagines how the event could have been avoided or changed. Also present may be fear, tension, and jumpiness (as tapped by the ANX scale) and the numbing, emotional avoidance, and derealization measured by the Dissociation scale. For some children, the ego-dystonic quality of PTS symptoms can be quite frightening, leading to fears of being out of control or "going crazy."

### Dissociation (DIS)

The Dissociation (DIS) scale measures the extent to which the child experiences mild-to-moderate dissociative symptomatology. DIS items include derealization, one's mind going blank, emotional numbing, pretending to be someone else or somewhere else, daydreaming, memory problems, and dissociative avoidance. Not included are more severe dissociative symptomatology such as identity disturbance or fugue states.

Principle components analysis of DIS revealed two factors, the first consisting of all overtly dissociative items and the second consisting of the two items involving pretending to be someone else or somewhere else and, to a lesser extent, a third item concerned with day-dreaming. Because the second factor involves fantasy or role-playing more than classic dissociation, per se, two subscales were created: Overt Dissociation (DIS-O) and Fantasy (DIS-F). The daydreaming item was included in DIS-F, because it appears to share item content associated with fantasy, although it loaded less highly on this factor (c = .20) in the principle components analysis.

Children with clinically significant elevations on the DIS scale (especially DIS-O) often present with reduced responsivity to the external environment, emotional detachment, and a tendency to cognitively avoid negative affect. Those scoring high on DIS-F may be seen by others as overinvolved in fantasy to the exclusion of the "real" world and its demands. DIS responses may not be seen by the child as problematic or unwanted, as dissociative symptoms often serve to reduce painful internal experience (Briere, 1992; Putnam, 1985). When dissociative symptoms are perceived as negative, they frequently involve feelings of derealization or depersonalization.

### Sexual Concerns (SC)

The Sexual Concerns (SC) scale measures sexual distress and preoccupation. Some SC items tap sexual thoughts or feelings that are not symptomatic per se (e.g., "Thinking about having sex" and "Having sex feelings in my body"), but that are atypical when they occur earlier in development than expected or with greater than usual frequency. Other items tap unwanted sexual responses or conflicts (e.g., "Thinking about sex when I don't want to"), negative responses to sexual stimuli (e.g., "Getting upset when people talk about sex"), or fear of being sexually exploited (e.g., "Not trusting people because they might want sex").

Principle components analysis of the SC scale revealed two factors, one involving increased sexual thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and one tapping sexual conflicts, fears, and other unwanted sexual responses. These two factors were used to create two SC subscales: Sexual Preoccupation (SC-P) and Sexual Distress (SC-D).

As noted in chapter 4, the SC scale (as well as subscales SC-P and SC-D) were normed on a sample of Mayo Clinic children, whose T scores were slightly lower on all other scales than those of the rest of the normative sample. For this reason, the recommended 70T cutoff for clinical significance of SC, SC-P, and SC-D is 5 points higher than is the case for the other TSCC clinical scales (65T).

Children with especially elevated scores on the SC scale may have been prematurely sexualized or sexually traumatized. This can occur as a result of childhood sexual abuse, exposure to pornography, witnessing sexual acts, or, in the case of adolescents, sexual assault by a peer.

Elevations on SC-P reflect sexual preoccupation or behavior that is unusual for children of a given age group. For example, an SC-P raw score of 8 is atypical for an 8-year-old boy, yet within normal limits for a 16-year-old adolescent male. Children with elevated SC-P scores may exhibit precocious or compulsive sexual behavior, sometimes in socially inappropriate contexts. Friedrich (1994) and others have shown that such increased sexual preoccupation is sometimes (although not always) associated with childhood sexual abuse experiences.

Elevations in SC-D reflect distress or conflict associated with sexual matters or experiences. High scores on this subscale generally involve sexual fears and unwanted or ego-dystonic sexual feelings and behaviors. For this reason, the SC-D subscale correlates more highly with the ANX scale than does the SC-P subscale. The SC-D subscale appears to especially increase in the presence of sexual abuse, although not inevitably so. In her forensic sample of sexual abuse victims, Elliott (1995) found that the most common TSCC profile was an elevated (T> 65 in her study) SC-D scale, occurring in 29% of all victims. Similarly, Lanktree and Briere (1995) found SC-D to be the most elevated of all TSCC scales and subscales in a sample of sexually abused children.

It should be noted that some cultures and subcultures foster earlier sexual awareness and behavior than otherwise might be expected, leading to endorsement of SC items that are, in fact, within normal limits for that group. In such cases, the SC-P subscale may be elevated, whereas the SC-D subscale may not. Thus, although excessive sexual behavior in children should be evaluated in terms of its possible connection to sexual victimization experiences, not all elevated SC responses in this area (i.e., on SC-P) inevitably reflect abuse or inappropriate sexualization.

### Critical Items

An important step in the interpretation of a TSCC protocol is the examination of each of the eight (seven if the TSCC-A is used) critical items, presented in Table 2 along with their frequency of endorsement in the normative sample. These items, which examine potential self-injury, suicidality, desire to harm others, expectations of sexual maltreatment, involvement in fights, fears of men, fears of women, and fears of being killed, suggest problems or issues that may require more immediate clinical attention. As indicated in Table 2, however, nonzero endorsement of these items is not especially rare; thus, the examiner should not assume that a critical item response endorsement higher than 0 necessarily means that the child is at risk for any specific psychological outcome. Instead, a nonzero response to a critical item indicates the need for further inquiry regarding the level and meaning of the critical response. On the other hand, some critical item responses may signal the need for immediate intervention (e.g., suicidality), whereas others may indicate the presence of a dangerous stressor (e.g., reflected in a fear of being killed).

Table 2 TSCC Critical Items and Their Frequency of Nonzero Endorsement in the Normative Sample

| Critical item                                        | Percentage endorsing over 0 (never) |             |              |               |

## Profile and Interpretive Examples

The following examples present seven instances of traumatic events and subsequent TSCC responses, taken from the clinical, forensic, and normative samples described in this manual. Slight changes have been made to disguise the respondent or to explicate a clinical issue.

### Example 1

R.T. is a 12-year-old Black male, who was referred to a therapist after witnessing his mother being severely beaten by her ex-boyfriend. This assault resulted in his mother sustaining major injuries and bleeding profusely in the child's presence. Although R.T. had witnessed previous assaults on his mother by this man, the boy apparently had never been sexually or physically abused. As presented in Figure 1, R.T.'s TSCC profile is valid, although HYP is above average. As is sometimes the case for those who live in a violent or dysfunctional fam- ily environment, but who have not experienced actual contact sexual or physical abuse, this configuration is noteworthy for its elevations of ANX and DEP, whereas ANG, PTS, DIS, and SC are within normal limits. R.T. endorsed two critical items: 20 (Wanting to hurt myself) and 21 (Wanting to hurt other people). This profile suggests that, although R.T. may be experiencing dysphoria regarding his family and living situation, witnessing his mother's assault may not have produced classic symptoms of posttraumatic stress at the time of testing.

### Example 2

R.D. is a 12-year-old Asian female, who reports both extensive physical abuse from age 7 years to the present time by her mother and sexual abuse from age 9 years to the present time by an older brother. At the time of TSCC testing, she had yet to receive any counseling or therapy. This TSCC profile is valid, although HYP is somewhat elevated. As indicated in Figure 2, R.D. has substantial clinical elevations on SC, SC-P, and SC-D, as well as on ANX, DEP, PTS, and DIS-F. She endorsed the following critical items: 20 (Wanting to hurt myself), 34 (Not trusting people because they might want sex), 50 (Feeling afraid somebody will kill me), and 52 (Wanting to kill myself). This TSCC pattern is not unusual among children who have experienced chronic sexual and physical maltreatment; it signals not only posttraumatic stress, but also major sexual symptomatology. Individuals with such a profile and history typically require intensive clinical intervention.

### Example 3

S.H. is a 10-year-old Caucasian female, who was referred to a rape crisis center after she disclosed that she had been forcibly raped by a male of unknown age on her way home from school. Her medical examination revealed genital trauma consistent with forced sexual intercourse. She reports no other history of sexual or physical maltreatment. This is a valid TSCC profile, with relatively low scores on most scales. Examination of the SC subscales, however, indicates that SC-D was elevated, whereas SC-P was not a relatively common profile for children with acute (as opposed to chronic) sexual victimization histories (Elliott, 1995). Critical items endorsed by S.H. are 34 (Not trusting people because they might want sex) and 50 (Feeling afraid somebody will kill me). The absence of posttraumatic stress or (nonsexual) dysphoria suggests a relatively circumscribed response to the rape, although future posttraumatic responses should not be ruled out.

### Example 4

H.O. is a 16-year-old Caucasian male, who was evaluated for a series of violent assaults against other children in his neighborhood. He reports chronic and severe physical abuse by his stepfather from age 5 to 12 years. He does not describe any history of sexual abuse or other major stressors beyond his physical abuse. This is a valid profile with elevations on ANX, DEP, ANG, PTS, and DIS-O (but not on DIS-F). As is true of many nonsexually abused children, his SC scale and subscales were within normal limits. H.O. endorsed two critical items: 21 (Wanting to hurt other people) and 36 (Getting into fights). This profile and its associated critical items suggest that H.O. is suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress and that he may be using aggression as a way of externalizing this distress.

## Example 5

D.F. is a 16-year-old Hispanic male with no history of childhood sexual or physical abuse who was physically assaulted by several male peers during a gang altercation 1 year prior to evaluation. His injuries were sufficient to require a brief hospitalization. D.F. has a valid TSCC-A profile, with substantial elevations on ANG, PTS, DIS, and DIS-O. He endorsed two critical items: 36 (Getting into fights) and 50 (Feeling afraid somebody will kill me). This profile suggests D.F. is suffering from significant posttraumatic stress and dissociative difficulties, along with considerable anger. His continuing gang activity may be continuously restimulating and exacerbating these responses.

## Example 6

J.H. is a 10-year-old Hispanic female, who was referred to a forensic abuse evaluation center after behaving in an increasingly sexualized manner in class and on the schoolyard. J.H. made several statements suggestive of sexual and physical abuse during her interview, but these disclosures were often inconsistent, both intrinsically and across time. Family members suggest she may have witnessed the rape of her mother by her schizophrenic father. It is not clear whether her father had sexually maltreated J.H. On evaluation, it was noted that her thought processes were confused, but not blatantly psychotic. J.H.'s TSCC profile is invalid by virtue of a highly elevated HYP score (T= 102), as indicated in Figure 6. As per her presenting problem, SC and the SC subscales are dramatically elevated. All critical items but one (Getting into fights) were endorsed in this protocol. As is often the case, the invalidity of this profile does not indicate that abuse, witnessing violence, or other trauma has not taken place, but rather that the excessive extent and breadth of item endorsement precludes meaningful interpretation of individual scales.

## Example 7

A.F. is a 9-year-old Caucasian male, who is in treatment for school-related difficulties. It appears that he was sexually abused by his older stepbrother for an undetermined number of years. A.F. denies that the sex- ual abuse occurred, however, despite the presence of compelling medical evidence of chronic anal penetra- tion and the fact that his stepbrother confessed to sodomizing him. A.F. has an invalid TSCC profile, with an UND score of 76T. All other scales are below 50T, and there are no critical items endorsed above 0. Profiles such as this one often occur among children for whom a trauma history has been established but who, nevertheless, deny any victimization history (Elliott, 1995). Other children may present with this profile in response to a generalized denial or avoidance response set, irrespective of victimization history.

## Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC)

As a part of my interview, I conducted the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC). The TSCC is a 54-item self-report inventory used to assess trauma-related symptoms. It does not link symptoms to a specific stressor.

The TSCC is divided into two validity scales and six clinical scales. The scores on each of the six scales are categorized as _normal_, _subclinical_, or _clinically elevated_. The last category, _clinically elevated_, is often consistent with a degree of symptoms needed for elements of psychiatric diagnosis.

<template>

Using the manual above, compile this subject's results from this Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) evaluation according to the three steps below.

Step 1: Group the subject's results hierarchically by Scale and Subscale. Include both T scores and percentiles.

Step 2: Rewrite the results in paragraph form. Write one paragraph per scale, starting with a description of the scale. Give the T score and percentile score for each scale, even if it is in the _normal_ range (T score of 60 or below). For Scale and Subscale results in the _subclinical_ range (T score 60 to 64) or _clinically elevated_ range (T score above 65), provide a description of the relevant Scale or Subscale. Include both T scores and percentiles. All descriptions should come from the manual.

Step 3: Create the final output. Start with inserting the the template above. Then comment on the validity scales (UND and HYP). If the results are invalid, describe why they are invalid and provide no further interpretation. If the results are valid, reproduce the results of Step 2 in the final output. Review all results for accuracy, including checking the scores, percentiles, and descriptions. Based on the reviewed results, write a brief interpretation of the results.Then produce the final output.
