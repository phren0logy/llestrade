# Background

This chapter outlines the recommended interpretation of TSI-2 scales, subscales, and factors. Although this section presents interpretive hypotheses for each scale individually, the scales of the TSI-2 are not independent, and relationships among them should be considered when interpreting scores.

# Normative Comparisons

T scores are used to interpret the respondent's level of symptomatology on the TSI-2. These scores are linear transformations of the raw scale scores, derived to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Similar to percentile scores, T scores provide information about the individual's scores relative to the scores of subjects in the standardization sample. For example, a T score of 70 typically exceeds the scores obtained by 95% of the general population, although the non-normalized characteristics of these scores mean that the relationship between T scores and percentiles will differ slightly from scale to scale. Higher raw scores and higher T scores indicate greater degrees of symptomatology. For all TSI-2 clinical scales, T scores from 60 to 64 are considered problematic (i.e., above-average symptom endorsement that is likely have clinical implications), and those at or above 65 are considered clinically elevated (i.e., symptom endorsement that is of sufficient extremity that it represents a significant clinical concern).

# Critical Items

The eight critical items of the TSI-2 are presented in Table 2.1. These items represent issues or behaviors that potentially represent severe psychological disturbance, danger to the respondent, or danger to others. Note that the items are numbered differently on the TSI-2-A, and the first critical item included on the TSI-2 is not included on the TSI-2-A. If any of these items are endorsed at any number above zero (i.e., 1, 2, or 3), the clinician should interview the examinee regarding the basis for the endorsement and be prepared to intervene if necessary. Elevated responses to other items found within the Suicidality, Sexual Disturbance, or Tension Reduction Behavior scales also may signal clinical concerns that require immediate attention. The clinician is advised to examine the responses to Suicidality scale items, in particular, to identify potential life threats, as noted later in this chapter.

# Assessment of Validity in the TSI-2

The TSI-2 has two validity scales, Response Level (RL) and Atypical Response (ATR), that respectively assess (a) the respondent's tendency to deny symptoms that others commonly endorse, and (b) the respondent's overendorsement of trauma-related symptoms that others, even those with significant posttraumatic symptomatology, rarely endorse to any major extent. High scores on either of these scales may indicate invalid profiles, as discussed in the following sections.

## Response Level (RL)

On checklist measures, individuals sometimes respond by indiscriminately marking zeros rather than refusing to complete the test. The RL scale was specifically developed to determine whether the individual is responding in this manner. The RL scale consists of eight items that were unlikely to receive a zero rating in the normative sample. The RL score is the sum of the number of zeros the respondent marked across these eight items. As a result, scores on the RL scale reflect the extent to which the individual denies behaviors, thoughts, or feelings that most other respondents would report (e.g., "Making a mistake" [Item 63 on the TSI-2, Item 59 on the TSI-2-A]). Those with very high scores on this scale (i.e., people who marked an inordinate number of zeros) are likely to be especially defensive or avoidant, oppositional regarding test-taking, or otherwise unwilling to endorse commonly endorsed items. In the standardization sample, individuals with an RL T score above 75 were in the top 4% of RL item endorsers. It is recommended that administrations that produce RL T scores of 75 or higher be considered invalid.

## Atypical Response (ATR)

The ATR scale evaluates the tendency of the respondent to overendorse trauma-related symptoms on the TSI-2. A very high score on this scale may reflect (a) generalized overendorsement of all items, (b) specific overendorsement of PTSD items, (c) random responding that includes endorsement of rarely endorsed items, or (d) very high levels of distress. In clinical contexts, although overendorsement may reflect malingering or factitious disorder, it also may arise from a tendency to experience and/or report symptoms as being more intense than others do or an attempt to present oneself as needing clinical assistance (e.g., a "cry for help"). Some individuals with substantial child abuse or trauma histories have elevated scores on infrequency or "fake bad" scales as a result of the atypical or extensive symptomatology sometimes associated with posttraumatic disturbance (Briere & Elliott, 1997; Klotz Flitter, Elhai, & Gold, 2003).

A raw score of 15 on the ATR scale indicates invalidity and is the recommended cutoff (see chapter 4 of this Professional Manual for more information). The cutoff score is to be used only when assessing individuals presenting in clinical or forensic contexts. Screening or research on "normal" (e.g., general population or nonclinically referred university students) individuals should use the Gray, Elhai, and Briere (2010) cutoff score of 8, as described in chapter 4.

Although an ATR raw score of 15 or higher invalidates a clinical or forensic TSI-2 protocol, invalidity here refers to excessive symptom endorsement only. It does not support specific conclusions as to whether unusually high item response rates are due to malingering, a "cry for help," random responding, or some other factor. Further, an invalid ATR score should not be interpreted as information on whether the respondent has or has not been traumatized or whether he or she is suffering major posttraumatic symptoms.

## Substituting an ATR Item With the Mean of Other Items

It is often helpful to review elevated ATR items with the respondent to determine if his or her responses make sense in the context of his or her specific life situation or clinical presentation. For example, Item 14 on the TSI-2 or Item 13 on the TSI-2-A ("Feeling so irritable after a trauma that you got into physical fights with strangers") is rarely endorsed at any significant level, even among those with PTSD; clinical experience suggests that most individuals do not actually get into physical fights (as opposed to verbal altercations) specifically due to irritability, and even fewer get into physical fights with strangers. Nevertheless, it is possible for some individuals (e.g., a highly traumatized, recently returned combat veteran) to accurately report this experience; for these individuals, it would not be an indicator of invalidity. If the client provides a clearly valid explanation for excessive endorsement of an ATR item, the examiner should substitute the average of the responses to the remaining ATR items (rounded to the nearest whole number) as a replacement for the questioned response. This should only be done when the ATR item unambiguously reflects a contextually logical response, as opposed to symptom overendorsement. Even then, no more than one mean score substitution should be made, and information on this adjustment should be included in the report if it changes the validity of the protocol. It should be noted that, for those endorsing multiple ATR items, the average score minus one item response may still be highperhaps even higher than if the item is not replaced. This method of ATR item substitution is not directly supported in the TSI-2 Scoring Program (TSI-2-SP); if this method is used, the decision to substitute the mean score should be made prior to entering the data into the Scoring Program, and the revised ATR item score should be entered at that time in order to achieve accurate results.

## Race and ATR Scores

In contrast to the original TSI, no racial differences were found on the ATR scale in the TSI-2. For this reason, the TSI-2 does not require any adjustment of ATR scores for any specific racial or ethnic group.

# Interpretation of TSI-2 Clinical Scales and Subscales

The clinical scales of the TSI-2 measure the extent to which the respondent endorses 12 different types of trauma-related symptoms, six of which also have scoreable subscales. These clinical scales, in turn, can be subsumed under four broad categories of distress, as identified by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; see chapter 5 of this Professional Manual): Self-Disturbance (SELF), Posttraumatic Stress (TRAUMA), Externalization (EXT), and Somatization (SOMA).

# Self-Disburbance Factor (SELF)

## Depression (D)

This scale measures the extent to which the respondent experiences depressed mood and depressive cognitions. High scores on this scale reflect frequent feelings of sadness and unhappiness and a general sense of being depressed. Individuals with high D scores report perceptions of themselves as worthless and inadequate and a view of the future as hopeless. On a behavioral level, such individuals may describe periods of secluding or isolating themselves from others. Suicidality and/or self-injurious behavior are always a possibility in the event of a high D score. As a result, the TSI-2 critical items that tap suicidal issues, as well as the items comprised by the Suicidality scale, should be examined in combination with a follow-up interview when D is elevated. Suicidality should also be of concern when an elevated D score is accompanied by an above-average Tension Reduction Behavior (TRB) and/or EXT score, even if the Suicidality (SUI) scale is not elevated.

## Insecure Attachment (IA)

The IA scale taps respondent concerns and behaviors thought to arise from early relational losses and/or parental maltreatment or unavailability, including abuse and/or neglect, inadequate empathic attunement, and frightening or frightened behavior. These early negative experiences with attachment figures often lead to later fears, ambivalence, interpersonal insecurity, or avoidance in close relationships (Bowlby, 1988). Those with elevated IA scale scores may describe problems in forming or maintaining stable, positive connections with others and often either greatly fear abandonment and rejection in relationships or avoid relationships altogether. Some respondents may report significant interpersonal difficulties or dissatisfaction, whereas others may appear to avoid such distress by maintaining considerable emotional distance from others. These two forms of interpersonal dysfunction-avoidance of close relationships and anxiety about rejection or abandonment-are assessed by two IA subscales: Relational Avoidance and Rejection Sensitivity. In many cases, one of these two subscales will be endorsed considerably more than the other. In other instances, however, both subscales will be elevated simultaneously, potentially signaling a more ambivalent or disorganized attachment style.

### Insecure Attachment-Relational Avoidance (IA-RA)

The IA-RA subscale contains items relating to discomfort with and avoidance of intimacy and interdependence in relationships. Item content includes keeping people at a distance, avoiding close relationships, not wanting to be known or understood by people, discomfort with intimacy, and independence from others.

### Insecure Attachment-Rejection Sensitivity (IA-RS)

The IA-RS subscale focuses primarily on respondents' preoccupation with and fears about the possibility of rejection and abandonment. Typical items describe excessive concern about being rejected in interpersonal situations and being abandoned by desired or loved ones, needing attention in interpersonal contexts, and worries about not being liked or cared for.

## Impaired Self-Reference (ISR)

The ISR scale measures a variety of difficulties associated with an inadequate sense of, and inadequate access to, self and personal identity. Impaired self-reference often (though not inevitably) arises from abuse or neglect early in life, such that the child was forced to rely on emotional avoidance to reduce the effects of painful internal states and an externalized focus or "other-directedness" to detect and survive interpersonal dangers and/or abandonment (Briere & Scott, 2006). Over time, these otherwise adaptive strategies are thought to lead to (a) reduced access to internal states and identity functions, so that the respondent is relatively unaware of his or her needs, entitlements, thoughts, and feelings and (b) a tendency to view others as more immediately relevant and valid than oneself, with resultant susceptibility to influence, boundary issues, and inadequate self- determination. Individuals with elevated ISR scores often appear to have less self-knowledge and self-confidence, may vary significantly in their behavior and feeling states according to interpersonal context, and, overall, may not seem to have a stable sense of self. There are two subscales of ISR: Reduced Self-Awareness and Other-Directedness.

### Impaired Self-Reference-Reduced Self-Awareness (ISR-RSA)

The items of the ISR-RSA subscale refer to a general lack of self-knowledge, confusion over one's own thoughts and beliefs, difficulties forming goals, and inadequate access to an internal, separate self. Elevated scores on this subscale are broadly associated with identity problems, sometimes in the context of dysfunctional personality traits. In some cases, it is difficult to discriminate these problems from dissociative symptomatology. However, reduced self-awareness is more trait-like, representing a chronic inability to access a sense of self, whereas dissociation is more state-like, reflecting reactive separation from emotional distress.

### Impaired Self-ReferenceOther-Directedness (ISR-OD)

The ISR-OD subscale taps overdeveloped externality, especially as it is represented by a tendency to look to others for direction and, in some cases, information on reality. Elevations of this subscale are sometimes associated with childhood maltreatment, other forms of early trauma exposure, or having been raised in a dysfunctional childhood environment. Items of the ISR-OD subscale refer to being easily influenced by people, needing guidance from others, not valuing one's own thoughts and feelings when others disagree, being easily talked out of things, and varying access to one's sense of self.

# Posttraumatic Stress Factor (TRAUMA)

## Anxious Arousal (AA) Scale

Scores on this scale reflect the extent to which the respondent is experiencing symptoms of anxiety, such as fears, phobias, and panic, and/or autonomic hyperarousal symptoms such as hyperalertness, tension, or jumpiness. At high levels, these symptoms may be associated with a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD, acute stress disorder (ASD), or another anxiety-related condition or disorder such as generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. Because anxiety in its various forms is commonly associated with trauma exposure, elevations on AA are often present in the TSI-2 protocols of those who have been abused, assaulted, or exposed to disasters or serious accidents. Not all instances of elevated AA scales will reflect trauma, however. In contrast to the original TSI, the TSI-2 includes two subscales of AA: Anxiety and Hyperarousal.

### Anxious Arousal-Anxiety (AA-A) Subscale

The AA-A subscale evaluates indices of anxiety, such as worrying, irrational fears, nervousness, and fears of death or injury. Generalized anxiety, fearful preoccupations, and a specific tendency toward panic attacks are not uncommon among people with high AA-A scores. Such anxiety may be associated with exposure to a particular trauma or series of traumas, but also can arise as a result of other, nontraumatic etiologies or stressors.

### Anxious Arousal-Hyperarousal (AA-H) Subscale

The AA-H subscale includes symptoms associated with overactivation of the sympathetic (i.e., "flight or fight") nervous system, such as jumpiness, hypervigilance, irritability, and sleep disturbance. This subscale score is typically elevated in instances of significant posttraumatic stress, in which it represents the "D" group of symptoms for PTSD and part of the "E" group of symptoms for ASD in the DSM-IV . High scores on AA-H signal muscle tension, hyperalertness, or hyperreactivity to stress, states that are often experienced as quite aversive and that may motivate avoidance strategies such as substance abuse.

## Intrusive Experiences (IE)

The IE scale consists of items reflecting intrusive posttraumatic reactions and symptoms. These include nightmares, flashbacks (i.e., sudden, intrusive sensory memories of a previously traumatic event), upsetting memories that are easily triggered by current events, and repetitive thoughts of an unpleasant previous experience that intrude into awareness. These re-experiencing phenomena generally reflect the "B" group of symptoms associated with a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD and the "C" group of symptoms in the diagnosis of ASD. Such symptoms are typically perceived by the affected individual as egodystonic (i.e., unexpected and unwanted intrusions from "out of nowhere"), primarily involving recollection or re-experiencing of an especially upsetting event. As indicated by the normative data and validity studies presented in this manual, the presence of elevated IE scores is often, if not implicitly, linked to a previous experience of psychological trauma. High IE scores, therefore, typically reflect the intrusion of such traumatic material into current awareness, with subsequent distress. However, psychotic individuals with hallucinations and individuals experiencing intrusive thoughts associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder may occasionally have elevated IE scale scores without trauma implications.

## Defensive Avoidance (DA)

The DA scale consists of those avoidance responses generally subsumed under the "C" group of PTSD symptoms and the "D" group of ASD symptoms in DSM-IV . Individuals with elevated DA scores often report attempts to suppress or eliminate painful thoughts or memories from awareness, and frequently attempt to avoid events or stimuli in their environment that might restimulate such thoughts or memories. In many cases, high DA scores reflect a need to avoid recall or triggered memories of a specific traumatic event. However, some DA responders appear to be avoiding access to a much wider domain of traumatic memory, such as all experiences of child sexual abuse, combat, or a history of severe neglect and disattunement in childhood. DA items do not represent dissociation, repression, or other similar psychological defenses as much as they reflect the (generally) conscious, effortful process of cognitive and behavioral avoidance as a way of managing posttraumatic distress. Because the DA scale can be considered an overall measure of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral avoidance, elevated DA scores may be associated with a decreased willingness to discuss or process negative or traumarelated experiences in therapy.

## Dissociation (DIS)

The DIS scale measures the extent to which the respondent experiences dissociative symptomatology. Dissociation may be defined as a largely unconscious, defensive alteration in awareness, developed as an avoidance response to overwhelming-often posttraumaticpsychological distress. The DIS scale measures a variety of dissociative experiences, including cognitive disengagement, depersonalization and derealization, and outof-body phenomena. The DIS scale also includes a symptom not assessed by the original TSI Dissociation scale: the experience of having multiple personalities, a potential indicator of dissociative identity disorder (DID). DIS symptoms (with the exception of the DID item: Item 48 on the TSI-2, Item 45 on the TSI-2-A) generally represent the "B" group of ASD symptoms, as well as several types of dissociative disorders. Individuals scoring high on the DIS scale tend to report distractibility, "spacing out," and feeling out-of-touch with their emotions and sense of self. On occasion, they may experience anxiety associated with the aversive quality of intense depersonalization. Clinically elevated scores on DIS can reflect a dissociative disorder; in these cases, follow-up with a more comprehensive test such as the Multiscale Disso ciation Inventory (MDI; Briere, 2002) may be indicated.

# Externalization Factor (EXT)

## Anger (ANG)

Scores on the ANG scale indicate the extent of angry cognitions, moods, behaviors, and fantasies experienced by the respondent. Individuals scoring high on the ANG scale often describe anger as an intrusive and unwanted experience and may see their angry thoughts or behaviors as not being entirely in their control. They may also describe pervasive feelings of annoyance, bad temper, or a sense of mistreatment, such that minor difficulties or frustrations provoke contextually inappropriate angry reactions or behaviors. Because aggression toward others is possible among those with elevated ANG scores, the TSI-2 critical item regarding thoughts or fantasies about hurting someone (Item 87 on the TSI-2, Item 81 on the TSI-2-A) should be reviewed in such instances. An individual follow-up interview focusing on dangerous behaviors may also be indicated when the ANG score is high, especially when accompanied by an above-average TRB or EXT score.

### Sexual Disturbance (SXD)

The SXD scale taps sexual symptoms, conflicts, preoccupations, and dysfunctional behavior. In some cases, substantial elevation on SXD is associated with sexual trauma in childhood or later in life. SXD has two subscales, Sexual Concerns and Dysfunctional Sexual Behavior. Elevated SXD scores may be especially problematic for individuals in intimate relationships, either because sexual contact may be avoided (in the case of an elevated Sexual Concerns subscale score) or because of relationship-threatening behavior associated with poor sexual boundaries and reduced sexual impulse control (in the case of an elevated Dysfunctional Sexual Behavior subscale score). Because some individuals are sensitive to any questions about sexuality or sexual functioning, either for personal or cultural reasons, the alternate version of the TSI-2, the TSI-2-A, does not include any items on the SXD scale.

### Sexual Disturbance-Sexual Concerns (SXD-SC)

The SXD-SC subscale measures sexual distress and dysfunction. SXD-SC items tap sexual anxiety, negative thoughts and feelings during sex, sexual problems in relationships, and shame regarding sexual activities or feelings. Individuals scoring high on the SXD-SC subscale tend to report sexual conflicts, sexual dysfunction, and a general negative reaction to sexual situations.

### Sexual Disturbance-Dysfunctional Sexual Behavior (SXD-DSB)

The SXD-DSB subscale involves reports of sexual behavior that is, in some way, dysfunctional, compulsive, or otherwise problematic. SXD-DSB items include references to indiscriminate sexual contact, getting into trouble because of one's sexual behavior, sexual attraction to potentially dangerous or dysfunctional persons, and sexual risk-taking, including involvement in unsafe sexual activities. SXD-DSB has been associated with childhood sexual victimization, although this relationship is not inevitable. It should be noted that a clinically elevated SXD-DSB score does not indicate that the respondent necessarily enjoys or appreciates sexual contact, only that he or she has a pattern of impulsive or compulsive sexual behavior that may be maladaptive in some way.

## Suicidality (SUI)

The SUI scale evaluates self-reported suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Elevated scores on this scale are especially problematic, as they indicate a potential threat to life. Because SUI is an important source of information regarding danger to self, all significant endorsements on this scale should be reviewed and discussed with the test-taker, and, in the event of continued concern, appropriate actions (including a suicidal lethality assessment) initiated. There are two subscales of SUI: Ideation and Behavior.

### Suicidality-Ideation (SUI-I)

The SUI-I subscale includes items that refer to suicidal thoughts and fantasies, wishing that one were dead, and hopelessness underlying suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation is not uncommon among those suffering posttraumatic distress, but can also be found among those suffering from non-trauma-related depression or inescapable, highly adverse circumstances.

### Suicidality-Behavior (SUI-B)

The SUI-B subscale refers to actual suicidal behavior the respondent has engaged in over the prior 6 months. Items include suicide attempts, previous aborted suicidal behavior, and involvement in dangerous behavior with a wish to die. Endorsements of SUI-B items should especially alert the clinician to possible ongoing suicide risk, since a significant predictor of a future suicide attempt is a previous suicide attempt (e.g., Gonda, Fountoulakis, Kaprinis, & Rihmer, 2007).

## Tension Reduction Behavior (TRB)

Tension reduction behaviors are external activities engaged in by an individual as a way to modulate, interrupt, avoid, or soothe negative internal states and thus may reflect underdeveloped affect regulation and tolerance skills (Briere & Scott, 2006; Briere, Hodges, & Godbout, in press). The TRB scale measures the individual's self-reported tendency to externalize and/or reduce distress through self-destructive or self-injurious behaviors, aggression, thrill-seeking, dysfunctional eating, dramatic behavior, and/or throwing or hitting things when upset. Because the TRB scale reflects a tendency to "act out" negative affect, this scale (along with the EXT factor score) can be seen as a gross indicator of the respondent's relative risk for behavior that is potentially injurious to themselves or others when he or she is stressed or dysphoric. High scores on TRB are often accompanied by elevations on the ISR, SXD-DSB, and/or ANG scale/ subscale scores and the EXT factor score and can sometimes reflect dynamics associated with diagnoses of borderline or antisocial personality disorder. However, some individuals with especially high stress or dysphoria levels may engage in tension reduction in the absence of an obvious personality disorder or especially dysfunctional personality traits.

# Somatization Factor (SOMA)

## Somatic Preoccupations (SOM)

The SOM scale indexes a general preoccupation with somatic dysfunction, a phenomenon sometimes found among traumatized individuals (Runtz, 2002; Walker et al., 1993). In many cases, this bodily concern is generalized, reflecting endorsement of multiple, but not necessarily strongly interrelated, symptoms (e.g., both ringing in the ears and muscle spasms). In other cases, however, the SOM score will be elevated due to high endorsement of only a few items, indicating concerns related to a single somatic symptom or syndrome. Preoccupation with bodily concerns can reflect an underlying psychological issue (e.g., somatization disorder, hypochondria), in which case these complaints do not arise (or do not arise solely) from actual medical disease or dysfunction. On occasion, SOM symptoms may reflect trauma-related idioms of distress in certain cultures or subcultures (Briere & Scott, 2006; Marsella, Friedman, Gerrity, & Scurfield, 1996). Importantly, the SOM score also may be elevated in individuals who have a significant and real medical illness or injury, who are understandably concerned about-or preoccupied with-their dysfunction or disability. There are two SOM subscales: General and Pain.

### Somatic Preoccupations-Pain (SOM-P)

The SOM-P subscale refers to specific endorsements of pain symptoms. Elevated scores on this subscale are often associated with complaints such as back pain, diffuse aches and pains, and painful muscle spasms. In some cases, these symptoms may be relatively chronic in nature.

## Somatic Preoccupations-General (SOM-G)

The SOM-G subscale items include references to a wide range of symptoms, including nausea, muscle spasms, balance problems, and difficulties swallowing. Elevations on this subscale suggest an increased likelihood of generalized somatization, often of psychological origin.

# Interpretation of TSI-2 Factors

Because certain scale and subscale scores are likely to be elevated in the same individual, the TSI-2 includes four factors, Self-Disturbance, Posttraumatic Stress, Externalization, and Somatization, which are derived from the results of the confirmatory factor analysis (CFAs) reported in chapter 5 of this Professional Manual. These factors allow for the consideration of broader symptom domains and can serve as summary measures of complex posttraumatic disturbance. The scale and subscale composition of these four factor scores is presented in Table 3.1.

Table 3.1:

- Self-Disturbance (SELF)
  - Depression(D)
  - Insecure Attachment (IA)
    - Relational Avoidance (IA-RA)
    - Rejection Sensitivity (IA-RS)
  - Impaired Self-Reference (ISR)
    - Reduced Self-Awareness (ISR-RSA)
    - Other-Directedness (ISR-OD)
- Posttraumatic Stress (TRAUMA)
  - Anxious Arousal (AA)
    - Anxiety (AA-A)
    - Hyperarousal (AA-H)
  - Intrusive Experiences (IE)
  - Defensive Avoidance (DA)
  - Dissociation (DIS)
- Externalization (EXT)
  - Anger (ANG)
  - Sexual Disturbance (SXD)
    - Sexual Concerns (SXD-SC)
    - Dysfunctional Sexual Behavior (SXD-DSB)
  - Suicidality (SUI)
    - Ideation (SUI-I)
    - Behavior (SUI-B)
  - Tension Reduction Behavior (TRB)
- Somatization (SOMA)
  - Somatic Preoccupations (SOM)
    - Pain (SOM-P)
    - General (SOM-G)

## Self-Disturbance (SELF)

Based on the CFAs, the SELF factor consists of the unit-weighted sum both Insecure Attachment subscales (Relational Avoidance and Reject ion Sensitivity), both Impaired Self-Reference subscales (Reduced SelfAwareness and Other-Directedness), and the Depression scale. In contrast to the original TSI, where the SELF factor included tension reduction behavior, the TSI-2 SELF factor reflects a more narrow and specific outcomedisturbed or altered perception of self and others (i.e., distorted relational schema), with a relative inability to access a stable, internal sense of self or identity from which to interact with the external world. This combination of difficulties may lead to ambivalent, insecure, and often problematic interactions with others, a tendency to rely on other people for information about self, and a greater susceptibility to influence by others. This relative lack of a stable, ongoing model of self or identity, in combination with disturbed relationships with others, often leads to depressive, or at least dysthymic, emotional states, as indicated by the contribution of the Depression scale to this factor. Although relatively uncommon, some individuals with a grossly inadequate sense of self (i.e., a very high score on SELF) may report difficulties accessing a stable internal model of reality, to the extent that they can occasionally appear to have a formal thought disorder.

## Posttraumatic Stress (TRAUMA)

The TRAUMA factor consists of the Intrusive Experi ences scales, Defensive Avoidance, both Anxious Arousal subscales (Anxiety and Hyperarousal), and Dissociation. As in the original TSI, this factor represents symptoms or associated features of PTSD, as well as dissociative symptoms associated with ASD. Thus, individuals with elevations on the TRAUMA factor tend to report some combination of flashbacks, nightmares, intrusive or triggered memories, cognitive or behavioral avoidance of reminders of previous traumatic events, sympathetic hyperarousal (e.g., sleep disturbance, jumpiness, irritability, hyperalertness), and various dissociative symptoms. Although TRAUMA factor items do not explicitly refer to a specific traumatic event, in almost all cases respondents with elevated TRAUMA scores have undergone one or more major traumas in their lives. As described in chapter 5, elevated scores on the TRAUMA factor suggest a significant likelihood that the individual will meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD. A PTSD diagnosis should not be made or excluded based solely on the TRAUMA factor score, however.

## Externalization (EXT)

The EXT factor is new to the TSI-2. This factor is the sum of six unit-weighted scales or subscales: the Anger and Tension Reduction Behavior scales, and both subscales of the Sexual Disturbance scale (Sexual Concerns and Dysfunctional Sexual Behavior) and the Suicidality scale (Ideation and Behavior). Individuals with elevated EXT scores are prone to exhibit problematic, self-destructive, or aggressive behaviors as a way to deal with overwhelming internal (often trauma-related) states and/or substantially diminished or underdeveloped affect regulation capacities. Such "acting out" may represent behavioral avoidance because the items and scales of this factor reflect behaviors that provide distraction or tension reduction in the service of avoiding especially negative affective states. A history of severe child abuse and/or neglect may be associated with elevated EXT scores. Some individuals who obtain high EXT scores will meet criteria for a Cluster B personality disorder (e.g., borderline or antisocial personality disorder), although not all those with high EXT factor scores are diagnosable as such. Substance abuse may also be a problem for those with elevated EXT (and/or TRB) scores and should be evaluated when this factor score is in the clinical range. Elevations of this factor score may be especially concerning when certain TSI-2 scale scores (e.g., Anger or Depression) are above normal, as such a combination may reflect aggression toward others or suicide risk, respectively. As noted elsewhere, the scales composing the EXT factor should be reviewed whenever this factor score is clinically elevated. Note that if the TSI-2-A is administered instead of the full TSI-2, the possibility of excessive, inappropriate, or unsafe sexual behavior cannot be evaluated, as the alternate version of the EXT factor, EXT-A, does not include the Sexual Disturbance scale or its subscales.

## Somatization (SOMA)

The interpretation of the SOMA factor is equivalent to that of the Somatic Preoccupations scale described earlier in this chapter, as this CFA-derived factor is solely comprised of the two Somatic Preoccupations subscales (Pain and General). Thus, high scores on this factor indicate a general preoccupation with bodily concerns, either for psychological reasons or as a result of preoccupation with actual physical disease, dysfunction, or pain.

# Evaluation of Change Using the TSI-2

The TSI-2 allows the clinician to determine whether a respondent's symptoms have meaningfully improved or worsened between two administrations. Using the appropriate table in Appendix C, the clinician can determine the probability (at four increasing levels of statistical significance: p ≤ .15 to p ≤ .01) that a change in a given scale, subscale, or factor score over time represents statistically significant improvement or deterioration, as opposed to being due to chance. In most cases, a change at the p ≤ .15 level should be considered statistically significant, although some clinicians (and researchers) may prefer that symptom changes meet conventional alpha levels (i.e., p ≤ .05 or even p ≤ .01) before considering them significant.

## Statistical Versus Meaningful Change

When the respondent's change in TSI-2 scores from Time 1 to Time 2 meets the criteria just mentioned, the result is referred to as statistically significant change . However, such changes may be statistically significant,
yet not especially clinically meaningful. For example, a respondent may demonstrate a decrease in symptomatology that is significant at a p ≤ .05 level, yet his or her scale T score might still be in the problematic or clinically elevated range. Although this symptom reduction is noteworthy, it may not be considered a sufficient outcome, as the respondent is still quite symptomatic. For this reason, a second TSI-2 outcome descriptor, clinically meaningful change, also can be used. This more stringent descriptor is applied to change that both (a) is statistically significant, as defined earlier, and (b) necessitates a shift into a different qualitative descriptor category (i.e., from problematic to normal , or from clinically elevated to problematic).

## Trauma Symptom Inventory 2 (TSI-2)

As a part of my interview, I conducted the Trauma Symptom Inventory version 2 (TSI-2). The TSI-2 is a 136-item self-report inventory used to assess trauma-related symptoms. It does not link symptoms to a specific stressor.

The TSI-2 is divided into four factors, with 12 clinical scales spread across the four factors. The scores on each of the 12 scales are categorized as _normal_, _problematic_, or _clinically elevated_. The last category, _clinically elevated_, is often consistent with a degree of symptoms needed for elements of psychiatric diagnosis.

</template>

Using the manual above, compile this subject's results from this Trauma Symptom Inventory 2 evaluation according to the three steps below.

Step 1: Group the subject's results hierarchically by Factor, then Scale, then Subscale. Include T scores.

Step 2: Rewrite the results in paragraph form. Write one paragraph per Factor, starting with a description of the Factor. Give the T score for each Factor, even if it is in the _normal_ range (T score of 60 or below). For Scale and Subscale results in the _problematic_ range (T score 60 to 64) or _clinically elevated_ range (T score above 65), give the T score, the result (_problematic_ or _clinically elevated_), and a description of the relevant scale or subscale. All descriptions should come from the manual.

Step 3: Create the final output. Start with inserting the template, which is wrapped in "template" tags. Then comment on the validity scales (ATR and RL). If the results are invalid, describe why they are invalid and provide no further interpretation. If the results are valid, reproduce the results of Step 2 in the final output. Review all results for accuracy, including checking the scores, percentiles, and descriptions. Based on the reviewed results, write a brief interpretation of the results. Then produce the final output.
