# Next Steps - January 11, 2025

## Completed Today
✅ Fixed critical thread safety issues in worker threads
✅ Eliminated direct UI access from background threads
✅ Updated tests to match new implementation
✅ Documented changes in unified implementation plan

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Test and Verify Stability (1-2 days)
- [ ] Run the application with debug mode (`./run_debug.sh`) for extended periods
- [ ] Test with various LLM providers (Anthropic, Gemini, Azure)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during long operations
- [ ] Verify no more malloc double-free errors
- [ ] Test with large document sets to ensure stability

### 2. Complete Directory Reorganization (2-3 days)
Since the critical bugs are fixed, we can now safely reorganize:
- [ ] Create `src/legacy/` and `src/new/` directories
- [ ] Move current UI code to `src/legacy/`:
  - `ui/` → `src/legacy/ui/`
  - Keep shared components in `src/common/`
- [ ] Update all imports in legacy code
- [ ] Ensure tests still pass after reorganization
- [ ] Update documentation paths

### 3. Begin New UI Implementation (1 week)
Start with the foundation classes:
- [ ] Create `src/new/core/secure_settings.py` for API key management
- [ ] Create `src/new/core/project_manager.py` for project files
- [ ] Create `src/new/core/stage_manager.py` for workflow control
- [ ] Implement base stage class with proper cleanup
- [ ] Create first stage: ProjectSetupStage

### 4. Memory Profiling (Ongoing)
Now that thread safety is fixed:
- [ ] Add memory profiling to debug dashboard
- [ ] Create memory usage benchmarks
- [ ] Identify remaining memory leaks
- [ ] Document memory usage patterns

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling (3-4 days)
Build on the thread safety improvements:
- [ ] Create centralized error reporting system
- [ ] Add crash recovery mechanism
- [ ] Implement better error messages for users
- [ ] Add error analytics/telemetry (opt-in)

## Recommended Development Workflow

1. **Continue using the current UI** for daily work while developing the new one
2. **Test new features in isolation** before integration
3. **Keep both UIs functional** throughout development
4. **Use feature flags** for gradual rollout of new components

## Technical Debt to Address

### High Priority
- [ ] Remove deprecated Qt patterns (if any remain)
- [ ] Standardize error handling across all workers
- [ ] Add type hints throughout the codebase
- [ ] Improve test coverage for edge cases

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Optimize LLM API calls (batch where possible)
- [ ] Implement proper caching for token counts
- [ ] Add performance metrics/logging
- [ ] Create developer documentation

### Low Priority
- [ ] Modernize UI styling
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Implement themes/dark mode
- [ ] Add more comprehensive tooltips

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Before major changes**: Create tagged releases
2. **Test thoroughly**: Especially memory-intensive operations
3. **Monitor user feedback**: Keep communication channels open
4. **Have rollback plan**: Ensure easy revert if issues arise

## Success Criteria for Next Phase

- [ ] Application runs for 8+ hours without memory growth
- [ ] No crashes during normal operations
- [ ] All existing features work correctly
- [ ] New UI framework in place and tested
- [ ] Clear migration path documented

## Questions to Consider

1. Should we add telemetry/analytics to better understand usage patterns?
2. Do we need a beta testing program for the new UI?
3. Should we implement an auto-update system now or later?
4. What's the priority for distribution/packaging improvements?

## Notes

- The thread safety fixes were critical and should significantly improve stability
- The new UI development can now proceed with confidence
- Consider creating a public roadmap for transparency
