# Feature Ideas from Streamlit Sample Code

This document captures interesting features from the deleted Streamlit sample code that could potentially be implemented in the PySide6 application.

## 1. Cost Tracking

The Streamlit implementation tracked API costs per session:

- Calculated costs based on token usage for each LLM provider
- Displayed running total in the sidebar
- Could track costs per document, per session, or per project

**Implementation ideas for PySide6:**

- Add a cost tracking widget to the status bar
- Store cost data in app_settings.json
- Create a cost report dialog showing usage over time

## 2. Model Auto-Discovery

The Streamlit app automatically discovered available models on startup:

- Checked which API keys were configured
- Tested connectivity to each provider
- Displayed available models in a dropdown

**Implementation ideas for PySide6:**

- Already partially implemented in app_config.py
- Could add a "Refresh Models" button to settings
- Show model capabilities (context window, features) in UI

## 3. Langfuse Integration

The sample code included Langfuse integration for LLM monitoring:

- Tracked all LLM calls with metadata
- Provided analytics on usage patterns
- Helped debug prompt effectiveness

**Implementation ideas for PySide6:**

- Add optional Langfuse configuration to settings
- Wrap LLM calls with Langfuse tracking
- Create analytics dashboard showing usage patterns

## 4. Session State Management

The Streamlit app used sophisticated session state:

- Preserved work between page switches
- Allowed saving/loading session states
- Tracked history of all operations

**Implementation ideas for PySide6:**

- Create session save/load functionality
- Add "Recent Sessions" menu
- Auto-save session state periodically

## 5. Template Gallery

The sample included a template gallery page:

- Browse pre-made report templates
- Preview templates before using
- Import templates from URL

**Implementation ideas for PySide6:**

- Add template browser dialog
- Support importing templates from GitHub
- Allow sharing templates between users

## 6. Real-time Progress Indicators

Better progress tracking than current implementation:

- Token counting during generation
- Estimated time remaining
- Ability to pause/resume operations

**Implementation ideas for PySide6:**

- Enhance progress dialogs with more details
- Add pause/resume to long operations
- Show token usage in real-time

## 7. Move to LangFuse for prompt management

## 8. Package application for distribution

- Replace .env file and the folder of templates with an option that is more distribution-friendly

## Notes

These features were part of a different UI paradigm (Streamlit's page-based approach) so implementation in PySide6 would need to be adapted to fit the desktop application model. The most valuable features appear to be cost tracking, model auto-discovery, and enhanced progress indicators.
