### Test Update Plan for `report-drafter`

**Core Observations from Code Review:** [DONE]

- **`AnalysisTab` Orchestration:** [DONE]
  - Individual document summaries are now consistently saved in a subdirectory defined by `SUMMARIES_SUBDIR` (value: "summaries") within the main `results_output_directory`. [DONE]
  - The `summarize_with_llm` method in `AnalysisTab` correctly creates this subdirectory (`results_output_directory/summaries/`) and passes it as the `output_dir` to `LLMSummaryThread`. [DONE]
  - The `combine_summaries` method correctly reads individual summaries from this `summaries` subdirectory and writes the `COMBINED_SUMMARY_FILENAME` to the root of `results_output_directory`. [DONE]
  - A key change is in `generate_integrated_analysis`: the input `combined_summary_path` is now expected to be within the `summaries` subdirectory (e.g., `results_output_directory/summaries/{subject_name}_Combined_Summaries.md`), not the root of `results_output_directory`. [DONE]
- **`LLMSummaryThread` Responsibility:** [DONE]
  - Receives the specific output directory (which will be `results_output_directory/summaries/`) and is responsible for writing its summary file (e.g., `basename_summary.md`) into that directory. [DONE]
- **`IntegratedAnalysisThread`:** [DONE]
  - Its primary role regarding file I/O for this testing focus is reading the combined summary (path provided by `AnalysisTab`) and writing its final integrated analysis report to the `results_output_directory`. [DONE]

**Plan to Update Tests:**

**Part 1: Update `test_analysis_tab_file_operations.py`** [DONE]

This file tests how `AnalysisTab` handles file operations and orchestrates other components like `LLMSummaryThread`. [DONE]

1.  **Adjust Global Test Setup & Mocks:** [DONE]

    - Ensure constants like `SUMMARIES_SUBDIR` and `COMBINED_SUMMARY_FILENAME` from `analysis_tab.py` are accurately reflected or used in test assertions if necessary. [DONE]
    - The `QTimer.singleShot` mocking seems to be handled well by your current comprehensive mocking setup. [DONE]

2.  **Refine `test_summarize_with_llm_writes_to_summaries_subdir`:** [DONE]

    - **Verification:** This test should confirm that `AnalysisTab.summarize_with_llm` correctly: [DONE]
      - Identifies input markdown files. [DONE]
      - Creates the `results_output_directory/summaries/` subdirectory. [DONE]
      - Instantiates `LLMSummaryThread` for each markdown file, providing the correct `output_dir` (i.e., `results_output_directory/summaries/`) and the path to the individual markdown file. [DONE]
    - **Actions:** [DONE]
      - Continue to mock `os.listdir` for the markdown input directory and `os.path.exists`. [DONE]
      - **Assert `os.makedirs` is called with `os.path.join(self.tab.results_output_directory, SUMMARIES_SUBDIR), exist_ok=True`.** [DONE]
      - When mocking `LLMSummaryThread`: [DONE]
        - Verify its instantiation parameters, especially `output_dir` and `markdown_files`. [DONE]
        - To test the "written out to disk" part for individual summaries: [DONE]
          - The mock `LLMSummaryThread` instance (or its `run`/`start` method if you mock those specifically) should simulate the file writing. You can achieve this by having the mock `LLMSummaryThread` itself use a mocked `builtins.open`. [DONE]
          - Assert that `builtins.open` is called with the correct path (e.g., `os.path.join(expected_summaries_dir, "file1_summary.md")`) in write mode (`"w"`) and that some expected content (even a placeholder like "Summary for file1.md") is written. [DONE]

3.  **Refine `test_combine_summaries_reads_from_subdir_writes_to_root`:** [DONE]

    - **Verification:** This test should confirm that `AnalysisTab.combine_summaries`: [DONE]
      - Reads individual `_summary.md` files from `results_output_directory/summaries/`. [DONE]
      - Writes the combined summary file to `results_output_directory/COMBINED_SUMMARY_FILENAME`. [DONE]
    - **Actions:** [DONE]
      - Mock `os.listdir` to return mock summary filenames from `os.path.join(self.tab.results_output_directory, SUMMARIES_SUBDIR)`. [DONE]
      - Mock `builtins.open`: [DONE]
        - Assert it\'s called in read mode (`"r"`) for each summary file within the `summaries` subdirectory. [DONE]
        - Assert it\'s called in write mode (`"w"`) for `os.path.join(self.tab.results_output_directory, COMBINED_SUMMARY_FILENAME)`. [DONE]
        - Capture and verify the content written to the combined file (e.g., check for headers, subject info, and inclusion of content from the mock individual summaries). [DONE]
      - The current logic in your test seems mostly on track; ensure all path constructions consistently use `SUMMARIES_SUBDIR`. [DONE]

4.  **Correct and Refine `test_generate_integrated_analysis_reads_combined_from_root` (Suggest Rename: `test_generate_integrated_analysis_reads_combined_from_summaries_subdir`)** [DONE]

    - **Verification:** This test must confirm that `AnalysisTab.generate_integrated_analysis` correctly determines the path to the combined summary file (which is now in `results_output_directory/summaries/`) and passes this correct path to `IntegratedAnalysisThread`. [DONE]
    - **Actions:** [DONE]
      - **This test\'s core assertion is currently incorrect due to the path change.** [DONE]
      - Calculate the `expected_combined_summary_path`: [DONE]
        \`\`\`python
        subject_name = self.tab.subject_input.text() # Mocked to "John Doe"
        combined_filename = f"{subject_name}\_Combined_Summaries.md" if subject_name else "Combined_Summaries.md"
        # This should be the path passed to IntegratedAnalysisThread
        expected_path = os.path.join(self.tab.results_output_directory, SUMMARIES_SUBDIR, combined_filename)
        \`\`\`
      - Mock `os.path.exists` to return `True` for this `expected_path`, for `self.tab.markdown_directory`, and for `self.tab.results_output_directory`. [DONE]
      - Assert that `IntegratedAnalysisThread` is instantiated with this `expected_path` as its `combined_summary_path` argument. [DONE]

5.  **Review `test_refresh_file_list_populates_from_root_and_subdir`:** [DONE]
    - **Verification:** Ensure `AnalysisTab.refresh_file_list` correctly lists files from both the root of `results_output_directory` and the `results_output_directory/summaries/` subdirectory. [DONE]
    - **Actions:** The current test structure seems to cover the path logic correctly. A quick double-check against `AnalysisTab`\'s implementation should suffice. [DONE]

**Part 2: Update `test_analysis_integration.py`** [DONE]

This file tests `IntegratedAnalysisThread` more directly. The primary goal here, related to your request, is to test that the final integrated analysis report is written to disk correctly. [DONE]

1.  **Refine `test_integrated_analysis_thread`:** [DONE]
    - **Verification:** This test should confirm that `IntegratedAnalysisThread`, after its internal processing (which can be mocked), writes its output file to the correct location (`self.output_dir`, which is `results_output_directory` passed from `AnalysisTab`). [DONE]
    - **Actions:** [DONE]
      - Continue to mock LLM interactions (e.g., `process_api_response`) to return mock analysis content. [DONE]
      - The output filename includes a timestamp (e.g., `f"{self.subject_name}_Integrated_Analysis_{timestamp}.md"`), making exact path prediction difficult. [DONE]
        - **Option A (Preferred):** Mock `datetime.datetime.now()` (if used by the thread to generate the timestamp) to return a fixed `datetime` object. This will make the output filename predictable. Then, mock `builtins.open` and assert it\'s called with the full predictable path in write mode, and verify the content. [DONE]
        - **Option B:** If timestamp mocking is complex, you can still mock `builtins.open`. In the mock\'s call assertions, check that the directory part of the path is `self.output_dir` (i.e., `results_output_directory`), that the filename matches the expected pattern (e.g., starts with `subject_name` and ends with `_Integrated_Analysis_... .md`), and that the correct content is written. [DONE]
      - The current test creates a temporary `test_combined.md` file. Ensure the path logic for reading this (if `IntegratedAnalysisThread` reads it directly beyond initialization) is also sound. The instantiation in `AnalysisTab` suggests it\'s passed as a string path. [DONE]

**Part 3: General Testing Best Practices (Across Both Files)** [CONSIDERED]

1.  **File Content Verification:** [CONSIDERED]
    - For critical write operations (individual summaries, combined summary, final integrated report), expand assertions to check not just that a file is written, but that its content has the expected structure or key pieces of information. [CONSIDERED]
2.  **Clarity of Mocks:** [CONSIDERED]
    - Ensure that what each mock is simulating is clear. For instance, when `LLMSummaryThread` is mocked in `test_analysis_tab_file_operations.py`, it\'s mainly to check `AnalysisTab`\'s orchestration. The mock `LLMSummaryThread` should then simulate the _outcome_ of a successful run, which includes creating a summary file. [CONSIDERED]
3.  **Consider a Dedicated `test_llm_summary_thread.py` (Future Enhancement):** [NEXT]
    - For more detailed testing of `LLMSummaryThread`\'s internal logic (chunking, prompt creation, actual API call handling, detailed error conditions within the thread), a separate test file specifically for `llm_summary_thread.py` would be beneficial in the long run. For now, we\'ll focus on ensuring its file output behavior as orchestrated by `AnalysisTab`.
